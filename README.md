# Haar-Transform
In mathematics, the Haar wavelet is a sequence of rescaled "square-shaped" functions which together form a wavelet family or basis. 
Wavelet analysis is similar to Fourier analysis in that it allows a target function over an interval to be represented in terms of 
an orthonormal basis. The Haar sequence is now recognised as the first known wavelet basis and extensively used as a teaching example.

Steps to run the code:
1. Open MATLAB and select the path where haar.m is stored.
2. Pass two arguments 'image_name' and 'threshold' to the function haar.m
3. Click on run and new image will be displayed and will be written to the current folder.
